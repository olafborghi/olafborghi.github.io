Welcome to my blog **Interdisciplinary Labyrinths**. As an interdisciplinary early stage researcher, I plan to share some of my experiences, helpful resources and tutorials within and beyond my fields of expertise on this page. I hope some of this may be helpful, and I am always happy to discuss any of this!

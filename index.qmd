### Olaf Borghi, MSc


I am an early stage researcher and PhD student in the MSCA doctoral network “[Interdisciplinary Perspectives of the Politics of Adolescence & Democracy](www.ippad.eu)” at Royal Holloway, University of London. In this project I investigate the relative contributions of cognitive and emotional traits to ideological thinking across the developmental window of adolescence.

We live in times of multiple crises, from the aftermaths of the COVID-19 global pandemic, ongoing armed conflicts across the globe, the climate crisis, to a crisis of our democratic systems with growing polarization and the rise of right-wing populist parties in many European countries. I am interested in how these crises influence how young people form their political identities, which cognitive and emotional abilities underlie their political decision-making and belief-updating processes, and how we can better support the political involvement of young citizens.

If you are interested in my work or would like to collaborate, please feel free to [contact me](mailto:olaf.borghi@rhul.ac.uk).

### Olaf Borghi - Early Stage Researcher

I am an early stage researcher and PhD student in the MSCA doctoral network “[Interdisciplinary Perspectives of the Politics of Adolescence & Democracy](www.ippad.eu)” at Royal Holloway, University of London. In this project I investigate the relative contributions of cognitive and emotional traits to ideological thinking across the developmental window of adolescence.

We live in times of multiple crises, from the aftermaths of the COVID-19 global pandemic, ongoing armed conflicts across the globe, the climate crisis, to a crisis of our democratic systems with growing polarization and the rise of right-wing populist parties in many European countries. I am interested in how these crises influence how young people form their political identities, which cognitive and emotional abilities underlie their political decision-making and belief-updating processes, and how we can better support the political involvement of young citizens.

Before joining the IP-PAD Doctoral Network, I completed a MSc in Psychology with a specialization in social neuroscience, cognitive psychology and research methods at the University of Vienna. In my master thesis, I investigated factors that modulate neural activation during action observation. I also worked as a research assistant in the Social, Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience (SCAN) Unit, where I contributed to projects on comparative neuroscience with dogs and humans, and in the Methods Department of the University of Vienna, where I contributed to statistics lectures and mindfulness research (see publications).

If you are interested in my work or would like to collaborate, please feel free to [contact me](mailto:olaf.borghi@rhul.ac.uk).

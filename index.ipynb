        "I am an early stage researcher and PhD student in the MSCA doctoral network “[Interdisciplinary Perspectives of the Politics of Adolescence & Democracy](www.ippad.eu)” at Royal Holloway, University of London. In this project I investigate the relative contributions of cognitive and emotional traits to ideological thinking across the developmental window of adolescence. I am particularly interested in how our current societal crises influence how young people form their political identities, which cognitive and emotional abilities underlie their political decision-making and belief-updating processes, and how we can better support the democratic involvement of young people.\n",

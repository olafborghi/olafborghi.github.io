I also got to opportunity to work as a research assistant in the Social, Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience (SCAN) Unit, where I contributed to projects on comparative neuroscience with dogs and humans and where I found my passion for research under the guidance of my mentors and supervisors Magdalena Boch and Claus Lamm.\nIn September 2023, I got the great opportunity to move to London to join the IP-PAD Doctoral Network and to persue a PhD in Psychology at Royal Holloway, University of London, with Manos Tsakiris as my primary and Kaat Smets as secondary PhD supervisors. At Royal Holloway, I am closely collaborating with researchers from the Centre for the Politics of Feelings and the Lab of Action and Body, as well as with researchers from the Department of Politics and International Relations.\nYou can hear more about my research project and myself in the short video below.\n\n\n\n\nIP-PAD MSCA Doctoral Network Member"

    "text": "Abstract\nAmidst multiple crises, converging reports indicate that young people are anxious about the future. Yet, how future anxiety relates to young people’s political attitudes and actively open-minded thinking remains unknown, presenting a critical research gap in times of democratic backsliding and political polarisation. In this study, we provide first empirical insights into the associations between future anxiety, political attitudes, and actively open-minded thinking among young people, considering the moderating role of emotion regulation strategies that could affect how future anxiety is cognitively processed and thus alter its implications. Our pre-registered analyses used original cross-sectional data from an online survey of N = 988 UK adolescents (aged 16-21), with additional conceptual replications in data from N = 997 Greek adolescents that included a subset of the measures from the primary UK sample. Results indicate that future anxiety is most strongly associated with stronger support for democratic principles in our UK sample, an association weaker among adolescents high in cognitive reappraisal. In both the UK and Greece, future anxiety was also associated with higher political participation. Follow-up analyses revealed notable gender differences: only among young men future anxiety was associated with more right-conservative ideological self-classification, a pattern replicated across both countries. These cross-sectional findings provide an important empirical foundation for research on the psychological contributors to and consequences of democratic backsliding and the development of political attitudes in times of multiple crises."

    "text": "Abstract\nEmpathy enables us to understand the emotions of others and is an important determinant of prosocial behavior. Investigating the relationship between mindfulness and empathy could therefore provide important insights into factors that promote interpersonal understanding and pathways that contribute to prosocial behavior. As prior studies have yielded only inconsistent results, this study extended previous findings and investigated for the first time the associations of two important factors of mindfulness (Self-regulated Attention [SRA] and Orientation to Experience [OTE]) with two commonly proposed components of empathy (cognitive empathy and affective empathy). Using a community sample of N = 552 German-speaking adults, the two mindfulness factors were differentially associated with cognitive and affective empathy. SRA correlated positively with cognitive empathy (r = 0.44; OTE: r = 0.09), but OTE correlated negatively with affective empathy (r = −0.27; SRA: r = 0.11). This negative association was strongest for one specific aspect of affective empathy, emotional contagion. Revisiting previously reported mediating effects of emotion regulation, we found that emotional awareness mediated the associations with both components of empathy, but only for SRA. Together, these findings imply that mindfulness benefits the cognitive understanding of others’ emotions via two distinct pathways: by promoting emotional awareness (SRA) and by limiting the undue impact of others’ emotions on oneself (OTE)."

    "text": "Abstract\nPeople often favour information aligned with their ideological motives. Can our tendency for directional motivated reasoning be overcome with cognitive control? It remains contested whether cognitive control processes, such as cognitive reflection and inhibitory control, are linked to a greater tendency to engage in politically motivated reasoning, as proposed by the “motivated reflection” hypothesis, or can help people overcome it, as suggested by cognitive science research. In this pre-registered study (N = 504 UK participants rating n = 4963 news messages), we first provide evidence for motivated reasoning on multiple political and non-political topics. We then investigated the associations of the two cognitive control variables cognitive reflection and inhibitory control with motivated reasoning. We find that associations between cognitive control processes and motivated reasoning are likely small. On political topics specifically, we find that a negative association with cognitive reflection is more likely than a positive association. This finding is contrary to predictions from the popular motivated reflection hypothesis. Results for inhibitory control are inconclusive. We discuss how these findings relate to interdisciplinary literature from cognitive and political psychology."

    "text": "Abstract\nObjective: Mindfulness is frequently seen as a protective factor of stress, but self-report measures of mindfulness may overlap with other related constructs, such as mental health, and could thus not only be a predictor, but also an outcome of stress. This study thus aimed to examine the longitudinal bidirectional associations between the use and perceived helpfulness of the four mindfulness facets Observe, Describe, Nonjudge, and Nonreact with daily perceived stress.\nMethods: Participants from a large (N = 1276) mixed student and community group sample filled out a brief daily diary over the time span of seven days. Bidirectional cross-lagged effects were investigated using the random-intercept cross-lagged panel model, an extension of the traditional cross-lagged panel model that allows to differentiate between stable between-unit differences and time-varying within-unit dynamics. In addition, we controlled for several baseline and sociodemographic confounders.\nResults: At the within-subject level, the use of Actaware was associated with higher perceived stress on the next day (β = .03, p = .029). The use (β = -.04, p = .025) and perceived helpfulness (β = -.05, p = .014) of Nonreact were associated with lower perceived stress on the next day. In turn, perceived stress was associated with lower perceived helpfulness of Describe (β = -.04, p = .037) and Nonreact (β = -.03, p = .038) on the next day. In addition, there were several residual correlations between mindfulness facets and perceived stress within days. At the between-subject level, there was a positive association between the random intercept of Describe and daily stress (r = .15, p = .003). In addition, while baseline perceived stress was negatively associated with the random intercepts of the mindfulness facets, two baseline components of mindfulness were not associated with the random intercept of perceived stress.\nConclusion: On the currently assessed timeframe, our results challenge prior results and assumptions regarding mindfulness as a buffering and protective factor against daily stress. With the exception of Nonreact, mindfulness was either positively associated with perceived stress, or in turn perceived stress appeared to interfere with the ability to stay mindful in daily life."

My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."

Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."

The developmental focus of my research works in two ways. First, I focus on adolescence and young adulthood – times of cognitive, emotional, and political change. Second, I study processes of belief development, examining how people incorporate new information based on their existing political stances, and different biases that affect political belief formation and updating. I also have a research focus on how young people feel about and imagine their future in times of multiple crises, and how this relates to their political views.\nIf you are interested about my work, would like to chat or collaborate, contact me!\nRecent News\nNov 2025 Our most recent paper, “Mind over bias: How is cognitive control related to politically motivated reasoning?”, has just been published in Cognition!\nYou can read more here: Borghi et al. (2026)\nOct 2025 The first paper of my PhD, “Facing a dark future: Young people’s future anxiety and political attitudes in the UK and Greece” has been published in a special issue on the Psychology of Pushback in Advances.in/Psychology.\nYou can read more here: Borghi et al. (2025)\nMethodological interests and open science\nMy work has a strong methodological and interdisciplinary focus.

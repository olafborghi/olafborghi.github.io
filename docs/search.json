    "text": "Abstract\nEmpathy enables us to understand the emotions of others and is an important determinant of prosocial behavior. Investigating the relationship between mindfulness and empathy could therefore provide important insights into factors that promote interpersonal understanding and pathways that contribute to prosocial behavior. As prior studies have yielded only inconsistent results, this study extended previous findings and investigated for the first time the associations of two important factors of mindfulness (Self-regulated Attention [SRA] and Orientation to Experience [OTE]) with two commonly proposed components of empathy (cognitive empathy and affective empathy). Using a community sample of N = 552 German-speaking adults, the two mindfulness factors were differentially associated with cognitive and affective empathy. SRA correlated positively with cognitive empathy (r = 0.44; OTE: r = 0.09), but OTE correlated negatively with affective empathy (r = −0.27; SRA: r = 0.11). This negative association was strongest for one specific aspect of affective empathy, emotional contagion. Revisiting previously reported mediating effects of emotion regulation, we found that emotional awareness mediated the associations with both components of empathy, but only for SRA. Together, these findings imply that mindfulness benefits the cognitive understanding of others’ emotions via two distinct pathways: by promoting emotional awareness (SRA) and by limiting the undue impact of others’ emotions on oneself (OTE)."

So far, however, all of them were fit using the frequentist lm() function. We want to change that and go Bayesian here. Let’s start by investigating the association between self-reported self-control and authoritarianism.\nSelecting priors\nI already scaled all variables of interest. This will make it a bit simpler to select priors. I will use weakly informative priors for our slope and intercept parameters (see https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Prior-Choice-Recommendations). The selected prior is \\(N(0,1)\\).\nIt is also recommended to conduct a prior sensitivity analysis. This can be done for example by refitting the model with a different prior and by comparing the results. We will thus fit another model using \\(N(0,2)\\) as my prior. Let’s plot both of them to see what kind of an effect they may have on our parameters.\n\n# simulate some data\nx_values &lt;- seq(-6, 6, length.out = 1000)\ndists &lt;- data.frame(x = x_values,\n                    y1 = dnorm(x_values, mean = 0, sd = 1),\n                    y2 = dnorm(x_values, mean = 0, sd = 2))\n\n# colors\ncolors &lt;- ipsum_pal()(2)\n\n# plot for N(0,1) \np1 &lt;- ggplot(dists, aes(x = x, y = y1)) +\n  geom_area(aes(fill = \"N(0,1)\"), alpha = 0.8) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"N(0,1)\" = colors[1])) +\n  labs(title = \"N(0,1)\", y = \"Density\", x = \"Value\") +\n  theme_ipsum() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n# plot for N(0,2) \np2 &lt;- ggplot(dists, aes(x = x, y = y2)) +\n  geom_area(aes(fill = \"N(0,2)\"), alpha = 0.8) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"N(0,2)\" = colors[2])) +\n  labs(title = \"N(0,2)\", y = \"Density\", x = \"Value\") +\n  theme_ipsum() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n# Combine plots \np_combined &lt;- p1 + p2 + plot_layout(ncol = 2)\nprint(p_combined)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that in the the plot for \\(N(0,1)\\), more density is around 0. As we expect our parameter values to be between 0 and 1, this gives more weight to parameter values closer to zero, and less weight to parameter values that are far from zero, compared to \\(N(0,2)\\) , where more probability mass is also on parameters that are a bit further from 0. If we would know that the association is large, and at the same time our sample size is low, we could think of using informative priors.\nHere we prefer the prior with less information - this prior also has a slight regularizing effect.\nLet’s check how our priors are set by default in brms.\n\nget_prior(aut_z ~ bscs_z, data = d)\n##                    prior     class   coef group resp dpar nlpar lb ub       source\n##                   (flat)         b                                         default\n##                   (flat)         b bscs_z                             (vectorized)\n##  student_t(3, -0.1, 2.5) Intercept                                         default\n##     student_t(3, 0, 2.5)     sigma                               0         default\n\nBy default brms sets non-informative flat priors for our slope parameters. We thus have to change this, and can do so directly when fitting the model.\nFitting and summarising the first model\n\nm1.1 &lt;- brm(aut_z ~ bscs_z, \n          data = d, \n          prior = c(prior(normal(0, 1), class = \"Intercept\"), \n                    prior(normal(0, 1), class = \"b\")),\n          seed = bayes_seed,\n          file = \"02_fits/fit_m1.1\")\n\nCheck the results. We can use either summary(m1.1) or print(m1.1) to do so.\n\nsummary(m1.1, prob = 0.95)  # prob = 0.95 is the default\n##  Family: gaussian \n##   Links: mu = identity; sigma = identity \n## Formula: aut_z ~ bscs_z \n##    Data: d (Number of observations: 334) \n##   Draws: 4 chains, each with iter = 2000; warmup = 1000; thin = 1;\n##          total post-warmup draws = 4000\n## \n## Population-Level Effects: \n##           Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\n## Intercept     0.00      0.05    -0.11     0.11 1.00     4111     2956\n## bscs_z        0.15      0.05     0.05     0.26 1.00     3702     2562\n## \n## Family Specific Parameters: \n##       Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\n## sigma     0.99      0.04     0.92     1.07 1.00     3605     3062\n## \n## Draws were sampled using sampling(NUTS).

We can use functionality from bayestestR for this.\n\n\nprior_summary(m1.1)\n##                 prior     class   coef group resp dpar nlpar lb ub       source\n##          normal(0, 1)         b                                            user\n##          normal(0, 1)         b bscs_z                             (vectorized)\n##          normal(0, 1) Intercept                                            user\n##  student_t(3, 0, 2.5)     sigma                               0         default\ncheck_prior(m1.1)\n##     Parameter Prior_Quality\n## 1 b_Intercept uninformative\n## 2    b_bscs_z uninformative\n\nOk - as intended our priors were uninformative.\nPosterior predictive check\nLet’s also check how well our model performs in generating data that is similar to our observed data. We call this a Posterior predictive check (PPC).\n\npp_check(m1.1, ndraws= 200)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npp_check(m1.1, ndraws = 100, type ='error_scatter_avg', alpha = .1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrace plot\nCommonly, we look at the trace plots, i.e., the estimated values across each iteration for a chain. See this nice practical guide by Michael Clark for some details. We will follow his code in several steps below.\nWhat should the trace plot look like? Ideally it should look like a series from a normal distribution.\n\nqplot(x = 1:1000, y = rnorm(1000), geom = 'line') +\n  theme_ipsum()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can also plot the trace plot from our model, using nice functionality from bayesplot.\n\nmcmc_plot(m1.1, type = 'trace') +\n  theme_ipsum()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrior sensitivity checks\nOk, so we fit our first model. We also want to check whether the choice of different priors would have a substantial effect. We refit a similar model, just this time with \\(N(0,2)\\) as prior for the intercept and slope parameter.\n\nm1.2 &lt;- brm(aut_z ~ bscs_z, \n          data = d, \n          prior = c(prior(normal(0, 2), class = \"Intercept\"), \n                    prior(normal(0, 2), class = \"b\")),\n          seed = bayes_seed,\n          file = \"02_fits/fit_m1.2\")\n\n\nsummary(m1.1, prob = 0.95)  # prob = 0.95 is the default\n##  Family: gaussian \n##   Links: mu = identity; sigma = identity \n## Formula: aut_z ~ bscs_z \n##    Data: d (Number of observations: 334) \n##   Draws: 4 chains, each with iter = 2000; warmup = 1000; thin = 1;\n##          total post-warmup draws = 4000\n## \n## Population-Level Effects: \n##           Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\n## Intercept     0.00      0.05    -0.11     0.11 1.00     4111     2956\n## bscs_z        0.15      0.05     0.05     0.26 1.00     3702     2562\n## \n## Family Specific Parameters: \n##       Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\n## sigma     0.99      0.04     0.92     1.07 1.00     3605     3062\n## \n## Draws were sampled using sampling(NUTS).

    "text": "Takeaway\n\nUsing the Bayesian approach we get much more than just a point estimate for our slope parameter of interest - we get a posterior distribution of parameters that are plausible given our observed data.\nAn increase of self control of 1 SD is associated with an increase of 0.04-0.26 SDs (median: 0.15) in authoritarianism.\nThe 95% HDI of our predictor of interest “Self-Control” does not include 0. We can thus say with a relatively high probability (according to common criteria - some authors also argue for 89% or 90% CIs) given our data that the effect is different from 0.\nThis is still true when we define and look at the ROPE - a region of practical equivalence. There is only minor overlap between the posterior distribution of our parameter and the ROPE (around 3%), indicating that the probability that our effect is practically relevant given our defined criteria is large."

    "text": "Abstract\nObjective: Mindfulness is frequently seen as a protective factor of stress, but self-report measures of mindfulness may overlap with other related constructs, such as mental health, and could thus not only be a predictor, but also an outcome of stress. This study thus aimed to examine the longitudinal bidirectional associations between the use and perceived helpfulness of the four mindfulness facets Observe, Describe, Nonjudge, and Nonreact with daily perceived stress.\nMethods: Participants from a large (N = 1276) mixed student and community group sample filled out a brief daily diary over the time span of seven days. Bidirectional cross-lagged effects were investigated using the random-intercept cross-lagged panel model, an extension of the traditional cross-lagged panel model that allows to differentiate between stable between-unit differences and time-varying within-unit dynamics. In addition, we controlled for several baseline and sociodemographic confounders.\nResults: At the within-subject level, the use of Actaware was associated with higher perceived stress on the next day (β = .03, p = .029). The use (β = -.04, p = .025) and perceived helpfulness (β = -.05, p = .014) of Nonreact were associated with lower perceived stress on the next day. In turn, perceived stress was associated with lower perceived helpfulness of Describe (β = -.04, p = .037) and Nonreact (β = -.03, p = .038) on the next day. In addition, there were several residual correlations between mindfulness facets and perceived stress within days. At the between-subject level, there was a positive association between the random intercept of Describe and daily stress (r = .15, p = .003). In addition, while baseline perceived stress was negatively associated with the random intercepts of the mindfulness facets, two baseline components of mindfulness were not associated with the random intercept of perceived stress.\nConclusion: In the currently assessed timeframe, our results challenge prior results and assumptions regarding mindfulness as a buffering and protective factor against daily stress. With the exception of Nonreact, mindfulness was either positively associated with perceived stress, or in turn perceived stress appeared to interfere with the ability to stay mindful in daily life."

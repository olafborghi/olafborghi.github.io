I was born and grew up in South Tyrol, a small multilingual region in Northern Italy. 

In 2018 I moved to Austria to study Psychology at the University of Vienna, where I completed a BSc in Psychology and a MSc in Psychology with a specialization in social neuroscience, cognitive psychology and research methods. 

In my master thesis, I investigated factors that modulate neural activation during action observation. I also got to opportunity to work as a research assistant in the Social, Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience (SCAN) Unit, where I contributed to projects on [comparative neuroscience with dogs](https://ccnu.univie.ac.at/) and humans and where I found my passion for research under the guidance of my mentors and supervisors Magdalena Boch and Claus Lamm.  

In September 2023, I got the great opportunity to move to London to join the [IP-PAD Doctoral Network](www.ippad.eu) and to persue a PhD in Psychology at Royal Holloway, University of London, with Manos Tsakiris as my primary and Kaat Smets as secondary PhD supervisors. At Royal Holloway, I am closely collaborating with researchers from the [Centre for the Politics of Feelings](https://www.politics-of-feelings.com/) and the [Lab of Action and Body](https://twitter.com/labactionbody?lang=en), as well as with researchers from the Department of Politics and International Relations. 

You can hear more about my research project and myself in the short video below.

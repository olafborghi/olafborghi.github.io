title: "About me"
---

I grew up in South Tyrol, Italy. I am a first generation academic, and before joining the IP-PAD Doctoral Network, I completed my MSc in Psychology with a specialization in social neuroscience, cognitive psychology and research methods at the University of Vienna. In my master thesis, I investigated factors that modulate neural activation during action observation. I also got to opportunity to work as a research assistant in the Social, Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience (SCAN) Unit, where I contributed to projects on comparative neuroscience with dogs and humans and where I found my passion for research under the guidance of my supervisors Magdalena and Claus, and in the Methods Department of the University of Vienna, where I contributed to statistics lectures and mindfulness research (see publications).

You can hear a bit more about my current research interests and myself in the short video below.
